hey guys!!
so basically theres a few things you have to do

first do 
    pip install audioset_download
    pip install librosa

Then run Audio_Download *THIS WILL TAKE FORREVVERRR* 

    python Audio_Download.py

Then run file Labeling

    python file_Labeler.py 

Then the AI  

    python AI.py 

    AND

    python Process.py

all of these will take a WHILE to run 
if you have the time let the audio download run for the whole hour or so 

then once you run the AI itll tell you the accuracy - if we can get above 80 that would be beautiful
I was able to get 55 with running the audiodownload for abt 15 mins
